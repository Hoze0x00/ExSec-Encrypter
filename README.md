# ExSec-Encryptor
Really simple encryptor using base64 and fernet. Includes Source code, GUI Version and Comand Line version of the project.
Created by me, under our groups name! This is the first version of the project, so report any kind of suggestions and flaws to me!

# Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/Hoze0x00/ExSec-Encryptor.git`
2. `cd ExSec-Encryptor`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Now you can use all of the scripts, by just running `python3 <file-name>`.

# WARNINGS!
- Make sure *NOT* to change any file names, or the program wont work properly.
- If the password is not on the file named in the source code. Change it to the location of the password file.
Steps to change the password file location:
1. Ctrl + H
2. Find = `C:\\Users\\{usr}\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\fn48fn39f8h984hfw94fh4fnoacn(HD)DN98dn8.txt`
   Replace = `<New-Path-To-Password-File>`
3. Save the changes.

If there are other problems with files/paths/directories, you'll have to repeate these steps again.
